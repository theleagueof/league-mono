# League Mono
=============
_by [Tyler Finck](http://www.tylerfinck.com)_

**Five weights of monospace fun.** 

League Mono is a mashup of sorts, inspired by some beautiful forms found in both Fira Mono, Libertinus Mono, and Courier(?!). 

League Mono was created in glyphs using masters for the UltraLight, Regular, and Bold weights, and interpolated instances for the Light and SemiBold weights. This, unfortunately, is not supported by UFO files, which is why there is a Glyphs source and source files for each weight.

It is still being refined as of the release: April 10, 2017
